    <div class="item3"> Over the summer I worked a lot mostly but did do somethings. In July, I went to a few start of
      the summer parties and then on my birthday which is July 18th, I went to restaurant called Crab House NY with a
      few friends and some of my cousins. Then my little sister was born August 28th which was really exciting but weird
      cause I've been the only kid for the past 16 years. Finally getting closer to September I got my permit to end the
      summer of with.
